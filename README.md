# Barber Booking System API

## Overview

The **Barber Booking System API** is a robust, Flask-based solution for managing barbershop appointments, user registrations, logins, barber schedules, and breaks. This API supports core functionalities such as booking appointments, retrieving available barbers and time slots, setting break times for barbers, and managing user authentication via JWT tokens.

**Key Features:**

- **Dynamic Slot Management**: When a user books an appointment, the selected time slot is immediately removed from the available slots, ensuring real-time updates and preventing double bookings.
- **Extended Booking Management**: Barbers have the ability to extend existing bookings, provided there is sufficient time before the next scheduled appointment. This allows for flexibility in handling appointments that may require additional time.
- **Availability Checks**: The system automatically checks for available time slots before extending a booking or scheduling a new one, ensuring that barbers can manage their schedules efficiently without conflicts.

The API is designed for scalability, allowing barbershop owners to manage multiple barbers with customizable availability and services.

- **Service-specific Barbers**: Not all barbers perform the same services. Each service can be assigned to specific barbers, ensuring customers can only book a barber qualified to perform the selected service.

- **Admin Management**: Admins can easily add or remove barbers from specific services, adjust their working hours, and set break times through the admin panel.

- **Customizable Schedules**: Barbers can define their working hours, set break times, and mark unavailable slots.

- **Comprehensive Barber Calendar**: The system provides a calendar view that shows all barbersâ€™ schedules, including booked appointments, breaks, and exception days. Barbers can manage their calendars by adding breaks, days off, or adjusting their working hours for specific days.

- **Break and Exception Day Management**: Barbers can add breaks throughout their working day and mark exception days when they are unavailable (such as days off or special working hours). The system reflects these changes in real-time, ensuring customers only see available slots during booking.

### Calendar Features

- **All Barber Schedules**: The calendar shows a comprehensive view of all barbers' schedules, including booked appointments, breaks, and exception days, allowing both the admin and barbers to have a full overview of availability.
